# The-Long-List

*The Long List* is a dynamic web app for generating grocery lists based on long-term meal plans. This project utilizes tech stack including MySQL, Java, Spring Boot and Thymeleaf templates.

## Functionality
Users complete workflows which allow them to customize their own ingredients based on the meals and courses they are planning. All plans, meals, courses, ingredients and grocery lists are saved to the userâ€™s profile through a robust database featuring a variety of persistent relationships.

### The Log-in Page

#### Figure 1
![Log-in view](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig1_login.png)
Users must be logged in to access the features of the website. If they are not a registered user, there is a link which allows them to do so. User authentication is performed using Spring Security.

### The Home Page

#### Figure 2
![Home page view](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig2_homepage.png)
Once a user has successfully logged in, they are brought to the home page. The top of this page has a simple nav bar which allows the user to access their plans and lists if they have already created them. Underneath the personalized message is a button labeled "Get Started" which directs both new and returning users to the beginning of the workflow for creating new meal plans (or just **Plans**) and generating grocery **Lists**.

### *My Plans*

#### Figure 3
![My Plans view](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig3_myplans.png)
Both the "Get Started" button and the "My Plans" option in the nav bar from the home page (figure 2) will direct the user to the *My Plans* page (figure 3). If the user has made **Plans** on *The Long List* before, they will see links to their previous **Plans** on this page. Following these links will allow the user to edit these **Plans** and create new **Lists**. At the botttom of the list of **Plans**, there is a button which allows the user to start a new **Plan**.   

### Creating a New **Plan**

#### Figure 4
![New Plan View](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig4_startnewplan.png)
#### Figure 5
![Plan View](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig5_planview.png)
Upon clicking the "Start a new Plan" button on the *My Plans* page (figure 3), the user is directed to a page which allows them to name their new **Plan** and determine the length of the **Plan** in days (figure 4). For the purpose of this demonstration, our user has decided to make a **Plan** for one week (7 days), and they have named their **Plan** "One Week Plan." When they click the "Next" button, they are directed to the main page for that specific **Plan**\* (figure 5). On this page, the user will see a list of links corresponding to each **Day** of their **Plan**. Because our user said they were planning for 7 days, 7 **Days** have been created. The user can now click on the **Days** to add **Meals** to them.

\* - It is worth noting that if a returning user clicks on one of the links on the *My Plans* page (figure 3), they will also be directed to that **Plan's** main page (figure 5).

### Adding **Meals**

#### Figure 6
![Empty Day view](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig6_dayviewnomeals.png)
When a user clicks on a **Day** in a new **Plan**, they will see a page that identifies the **Day** which they have chosen to edit, and the option to add a new **Meal** or return to the **Plan's** main page. As a user adds **Meals**, they will also see a list of links to those **Meals** in this view (see figure 17).

#### Figure 7
![New Meal view](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig7_addnewmeal.png)
The user will be prompted to create a name for their new **Meal**. This name should be something that distinguishes this **Meal** from other **Meals** created within the same day, and can range from generic (e.g. "Breakfast") to more specific (e.g. "Logan's Lunch").

#### Figure 8
![Meal view with no courses](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig8_mealviewnocourses.png)
**Meals** are made up of **Courses**, which are made up of specific **Ingredients** that are used to make those **Courses**. When a user creates a **Course**, it is saved to their profile and can be accessed via the drop-down menu when creating **Meals**. This user has already created a **Course** called "Fried Eggs," which presumably contains **Ingredients** like eggs, oil, salt, and pepper. The user selects "Fried Eggs" from the drop-down menu and clicks "Add Course" to add this **Course** to the **Meal**, "Breakfast" (as seen in Figure 9)

#### Figure 9
![Meal with course "Fried Eggs" added](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig9_mealviewexistingcourse.png)
Now our user would like to add the **Course** "French Toast" to their **Meal**. However, this **Course** is not an option in the drop-down menu because the user has not created it yet. To create a new **Course**, the user clicks the "Create a new Course" button on the bottom of the page.

#### Figure 10

#### Figure 11

#### Figure 13
![Course view with some ingredients](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig13_courseviewexistingingredients.png)
To create a new **Course**, the user must create a unique name and add at least one **Ingredient** required to make it. The user types the name and clicks the "Add Ingredients" button (figure 10) and is directed to a view which allows them to add **Ingredients** to their new **Course** (figure 11). The **Ingredients** drop-down menu (figure 12) contains all **Ingredients** that have been created by any *The Long List* users. This allows our user to easily add some of the **Ingredients** they need to make French Toast! The **Ingredients** "Bread", "Eggs", and "Milk" are already in the **Ingredients** drop-down menu and are added (figure 13). However, "Sugar", "Cinnamon", and "Vanilla Extract" are all missing from the drop-down menu. To add these, the user clicks the "Create a new Ingredient" button. 

#### Figure 14
![Create new Ingredient view](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig14_createingredientview.png)
#### Figure 15

#### Figure 16
![Meal view with new Course available](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig16_mealviewnewcourse.png)
To create a new **Ingredient**, the user must give it a unique name and select one of the prescribed categories. When the user is ready, they click the "Create Ingredient" button and are directed back to the **Course** page (figure 13), where they can now find their newly-created **Ingredient** in the drop-down menu and add it to their **Course**. Once all of the required **Ingredients** have been added (figure 15), the user can click the "Back" buttton to return to the **Meal** page. The newly created **Course** can now be accessed via the drop-down menu and added to the **Meal** (figure 16).

#### Figure 17
![Day view with Meals added](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig17_dayviewwithmeals.png)
As the user adds **Meals** to a **Day**, they will see links to these **Meals** populate the **Day** view. Once they have finished adding **Meals** to a **Day**, they can return to the **Plan** view (figure 5) by clicking the "Back" button, and from there they can continue to add **Meals** to the remaining **Days** of their plan.

### Generating Lists

When a user has finished adding **Meals** to all of the **Days** in their **Plan**, they can click the "Finish and Create List" button at the bottom of the **Plan** page (figure 5).

#### Figure 18
![List view top](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig18_listviewtop.png)
The resulting **List** contains all of the unique instances of **Ingredients** from the **Plan** which the user was creating. For instance, the **Ingredient** "Eggs" is present in both the "Fried Eggs" **Course** and the "French Toast" **Course**, but it is only listed once on the **List**. All **Ingredients** on the **List** are arranged based on the category of the **Ingredient**, allowing for a streamlined groocery experience.

#### Figure 19

#### Figure 20
![PDF view of List](https://github.com/las5h4/The-Long-List/blob/master/Figures/TLL_fig20_printpdfexample.png)
At the bottom of the **List** page, the user will find a "Print" button which allows them to print the **List** to take with them to the grocery store. Every time a **List** is generated, it is stored on the *My Lists* page, which can be accessed at any time via the nav bar. As seen in figure 21 below, every version of a generated **List** is saved. This means if the user later decides to edit one of their **Plans** and generate a new **List**, they can still access the previous version of the **List** from the *My Lists* page.
